# Apps & Packages

Omadeb provides several ways to install applications: through the Omadeb Menu with curated app installers, through an APT package browser, and via Flatpak.

## Omadeb Menu — Curated Apps

The primary way to install and remove applications in Omadeb is through the Omadeb Menu (`Super + Alt + Space`). Navigate to _Install_ to access the curated app submenus:

- **Service** — Desktop applications (1Password, Bitwarden, Discord, Dropbox, Obsidian, Signal, Spotify, Zoom, and more)
- **Browser** — Web browsers (Brave, Chromium, Firefox, Zen)
- **Editor** — Code editors (VSCode, Cursor, Zed, Doom Emacs)
- **Terminal** — Terminal emulators (Alacritty, Ghostty, Kitty)
- **Development** — Languages and tools (Docker, Ruby, JavaScript/Node, Go, Python, Mise, and more)
- **Utility** — Utilities (Flameshot, Pinta, Starship, and more)
- **AI** — AI tools (Ollama)
- **Gaming** — Games (Steam, RetroArch, Minecraft)

Apps installed through these menus can be removed via the corresponding _Remove_ submenus. This also works for the apps that come pre-installed, letting you revert to a lean base at any time.

## APT Package Browser

Beyond the curated app list, Omadeb provides direct access to the full APT package repository through the menu. Go to _Install > Package_ in the Omadeb Menu to open an interactive `fzf`-based browser that lists all available APT packages. You can:

- **Search** by typing part of the package name
- **Preview** the package description with `Alt + P`
- **Scroll** through the preview with `Alt + J` / `Alt + K`
- **Select multiple packages** with `Tab`
- **Confirm** with `Enter`

The selected packages will be installed via `apt`.

To remove APT packages, go to _Remove > Package_ in the Omadeb Menu. This shows a similar interface but lists only currently installed packages.

## Flatpak

Omadeb ships with [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org) and the [Flathub](https://flathub.org) repository configured. Snap is not present. Flatpak apps are sandboxed and install cleanly alongside system packages.

Several pre-installed apps (such as Chromium, LocalSend, and Pinta) are distributed as Flatpaks. You can also install additional Flatpaks manually:

```bash
flatpak install flathub <app-id>
```

Or browse the available apps at [flathub.org](https://flathub.org).

## Omakasui APT Repository

Omadeb distributes some of its own packages (Walker, Elephant, omadeb-nvim) through a dedicated APT repository. See the [APT Repository](/manual/configuration/apt-repository) section for details.
