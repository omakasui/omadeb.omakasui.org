# Themes

Omadeb comes with a curated set of themes. You can select between them via _Style > Theme_ in the Omadeb menu (`Super + Alt + Space`), or jump directly to the theme selector using `Super + Ctrl + Shift + Space`.

Each theme styles the desktop, terminal, Neovim, system monitor (btop & tophat), Zellij and VSCode.

Most themes also include a set of background images that you can cycle through using `Super + Ctrl + Space`.
