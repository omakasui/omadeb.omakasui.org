Omadeb is designed to be primarily operated via _keyboard_. While several shortcuts are available, familiarity develops quickly with regular use.

References to the `Super` key indicate the `Windows` key on most keyboards, or the `Command` key on Apple layouts.

## Workspaces

Omadeb provides _six preconfigured workspaces_.

On smaller displays, it is recommended to keep one primary application per workspace, or at most two. You can switch between workspaces using `Super + 1/2/3/4/5/6` . Workspace switching is immediate, without animations.

Maintaining a consistent layout across workspaces helps improve efficiency. For example:

| #   | Purpose       | App(s)        | Hotkey      |
| --- | ------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| 1   | Browsing      | Chrome        | `Super + 1` |
| 2   | Development   | Terminal      | `Super + 2` |
| 3   | Communication | WhatsApp      | `Super + 3` |
| 4   | Music         | Spotify       | `Super + 4` |
| 5   | Writing       | Neovim (btw!) | `Super + 5` |
| 6   | Miscellaneous | Other tasks   | `Super + 6` |

To move the focused window to another workspace, use `Shift + Super + 1/2/3/4/5/6`.

## Applications

Applications can be launched or focused in three ways:

- `Alt + 1`, `Alt + 2`, and so on start or focus applications based on their position in the dock.

- `Super + Space` opens the application launcher. Type the application name and press `Enter`.

- `Super` to reveal the dock and use the mouse if needed. The “Show Apps” icon displays all installed applications.

You can always close an application using `Super + W`.
