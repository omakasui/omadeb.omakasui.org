# Extra Themes

## Install from Omakasui

This [page](https://omakasui.org/themes) lists some officially supported themes for Omadeb. You can install any of these themes by copying the git URL and selecting _Install > Style > Theme_ via the Omadeb menu (`Super + Alt + Space`). If you want to remove it again, just use _Remove > Style > Theme_ and select it there.

## Making your own theme

You can add your own themes to `~/.config/omadeb/themes`. The easiest way to start is to copy one of the existing themes from `~/.local/share/omadeb/themes` and use it as a base.

As long as your theme lives in that folder, it will automatically appear in the theme selection menu.

The main file you’ll want to tweak is colors.toml. This file defines the color palette used to generate configurations for the terminal, system monitor (btop and tophat), desktop, application launcher.

### Light mode

If you’re creating a light theme, just add an empty file called `light.mode` in the root of your theme folder. This will automatically associate the theme with light mode across supported applications.

### GTK Theme

Omadeb uses a file called `gtk.theme` to define the GTK theme and, by default, the associated icon variant.

The value inside `gtk.theme` determines the overall visual style. Available variants include:

- Yaru
- Yaru-blue
- Yaru-dark
- Yaru-magenta
- Yaru-olive
- Yaru-prussiangreen
- Yaru-purple
- Yaru-red
- Yaru-sage
- Yaru-wartybrown
- Yaru-yellow

If no other overrides are present, the icon theme follows the GTK theme automatically.

To override specific components:

- `icons.theme`: lets you define a different icon set
- `cursor.theme`: lets you define a custom cursor theme

When these files exist, they take precedence over the default behavior defined in `gtk.theme`.

### GNOME accent

GNOME accent color is configured separately through `accent.theme`.

This file must contain only the accent name. It does not affect the GTK theme or the icon set, and it is handled independently from `gtk.theme`.

### Distributing your theme

If you’d like to share your theme with others, you can publish it on a public Git repository (for example, GitHub). Then it can be installed via _Install > Theme_ in the Omadeb menu by providing the repository URL.

It’s recommended to follow the naming convention `omadeb-[themename]-theme`, so the theme will appear correctly as `[themename]` in the theme selection menu after installation.

You can also install themes preceded by `omakasui-`, these are themes designed to be compatible with other setups present on Omakasui.
