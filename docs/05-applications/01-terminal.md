# Terminal

Omadeb's default terminal is [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org), a GPU-accelerated terminal emulator that is fast, minimal, and fully theme-aware. **Tmux** is the terminal multiplexer.

## Alacritty

Alacritty is configured without the system titlebar for a cleaner look, especially in combination with Omadeb's themes. Since there's no titlebar to drag, hold `Super` and click-drag anywhere in the window to move it. To resize with the mouse, use `Alt + Space > Resize`.

Font and size can be changed from the Omadeb Menu under _Style > Font_ or by editing `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml` — leave the referenced imports intact so Omadeb can continue to theme it.

### Alternative Terminals

Omadeb supports switching to [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) or [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) as alternatives, both fully integrated with the theme system. Install and switch via _Install > Terminal_ in the Omadeb Menu.

## Tmux

Tmux is Omadeb's primary terminal multiplexer. The `t` alias attaches to an existing session or creates a new one. Launch a Tmux terminal directly with `Super + Alt + Return`.

Tmux is pre-configured with `Ctrl + Space` as the prefix key (`Ctrl + B` also works).

### Keybinding Reference

`Prefix` + `?` opens a searchable popup listing every keybinding defined in your Tmux configuration. The same list is available from the Omadeb Menu under _Learn > Tmux keybindings_.

For Tmux layout functions like `tdl`, `tdlm`, and `tsl`, see [Shell Functions](/manual/applications/shell-functions).
