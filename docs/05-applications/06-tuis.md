# Terminal UIs

Omadeb ships a set of powerful terminal user interfaces (TUIs) for managing Git, Docker, system resources, and more.

## Lazygit

[Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) is a TUI for Git. Open it from any directory to manage the Git repository and running `lzg`. You can also open it using `Ctrl + G` inside Tmux (the Tmux leader), followed by `g`.

You hop between the different panes using `Tab`. In the Files pane, you select files for staging using `Space`, and then you can create a new commit using `c`. You can see all the commands available using `?`.

## Lazydocker

[Lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker) is a TUI for Docker. You can start it with `Super + Shift + D`. You stop a container using `s` or start/restart it using `r`. See all commands using `?`.

## Btop

[Btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop) is a resource monitor with a clean visual interface. Open it with `Shift + Super + T`.

It shows CPU, memory, disk, network, and process usage with mouse support.

## Fastfetch

[Fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) shows system info at a glance. It runs automatically at shell startup, and is also accessible as _About_ in the Omadeb Menu.
