# Welcome to Omadeb!

<div class="space-y-4">

**Omadeb** is an opinionated [Debian](https://debian.org) and [Gnome](https://gnome.org) configuration crafted for developers who value productivity and aesthetics, built with modern tools, sensible defaults, and zero bloat.

The project doesn’t just provide a ready-made configuration for newcomers to Linux; it also aims to create a comfortable and thoughtful environment, so you don’t need to struggle with setup. _Everything’s already in place—just open the terminal and start exploring_.
